This is template modules for deep learning with Pytorch.

# Source code details
- main.py is the main code to be executed.
- train.py trains models for 1 epoch.
- test.py tests models for 1 epoch.
- loader.py defines your own datasets.
- models.py defines your own models.
- criteria.py defines your own criteria for loss functions.
- logger.py saves the logs of metrics (loss, accuracy, etc.) .
- visualize.py visualizes some additional information.
- misc.py contains functions and classes which are not included in other files.

# Terms of use
- They cannot be used as they are. You have to change them depending on your task.
- They might have some bugs because they do not have test code for themselves. Bugs should be modified or informed when they are applied to practical tasks.
